A particle has initial velocity and acceleration. If its velocity after certain time is $v$ then what will its displacement be in twice of that time?

---
## Input

The input will contain two integers in each line. Each line makes one set of input. These two integers denote the value of $v$ ($−100 \le v \le 100$) and $t$ ($0 \le t \le 200$) ($t$ means at the time the particle gains that velocity)

---
## Output

For each line of input print a single integer in one line denoting the displacement in double of that time.
