# UVA-10098 - Generating Fast, Sorted Permutation

Generating permutation has always been an important problem in computer science. In this problem you will have to generate the permutation of a given string in ascending order. Remember that your algorithm must be efficient.

---
## Input

The first line of the input contains an integer n, which indicates how many strings to follow. The next n lines contain n strings. Strings will only contain alpha numerals and never contain any space. The maximum length of the string is 10.

---
## Output

For each input string print all the permutations possible in ascending order. Not that the strings should be treated, as case sensitive strings and no permutation should be repeated. A blank line should follow each output set.

## Sample Input

```
3
ab
abc
bca
```

---
## Sample Output

```
ab
ba
abc
acb
bac
bca
cab
cba
```
